 - Describe the extension online, probably at vi.mozdev.org.
 - Support editable trees. [1]
 - Optionally remember on/off state per-site, using FUEL or the Content
   Preferences service. [2] Maybe limit this feature to bookmarks (FUEL), since
   the UI to set the preferences would be easier to figure out.
 - The extension has some commented code towards supporting Thunderbird 3a1. The
   main issues are identifying the myriad of textboxes that AVIM should ignore,
   and finding a keyboard shortcut for toggling AVIM that won't conflict with
   any of the shortcuts used on any of Thunderbird's windows.
