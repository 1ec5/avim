 - Bug: "kilo^mét" (kilômét)
 - Bug: "xoa" (xoá) in rich text editors, including Thunderbird and Composer.
 - Convert XUL overlays into XBL bindings on XUL's root elements, to support
   absolutely every window. Most importantly, add the AVIM panel to all
   <statusbar>s and the Vietnamese Input submenu to all Edit menus.
 - Automatically convert q<[aeioy]> -> qu, g<e> -> gh, ng<[ei]> -> ngh, etc.
 - Add key mapping for the dong sign.
 - Add a preference to specify allowed initial consonant clusters, like mViet
   does. [1]
 - Optionally remember on/off state per-site, using FUEL or the Content
   Preferences service. [2] Maybe limit this feature to bookmarks (FUEL), since
   the UI to set the preferences would be easier to figure out.
