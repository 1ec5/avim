 - Support <searchvalue> elements in Thunderbird.
 - Automatically convert q<[aeioy]> -> qu, g<e> -> gh, ng<[ei]> -> ngh, etc.
 - Add a preference to specify allowed initial consonant clusters, like mViet
   does. [1]
 - Add key mapping for the dong sign.
 - Optionally remember on/off state per-site, using FUEL or the Content
   Preferences service. [2] Maybe limit this feature to bookmarks (FUEL), since
   the UI to set the preferences would be easier to figure out.
