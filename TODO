 - Scroll single-line textboxes to the side when AVIM modifies the input.
 - Figure out why the first word entered into a designMode document is flipped
   around (i.e., "DDa'nh" turns into "a'nhDD").
 - Add a preference to specify allowed initial consonant clusters, like mViet
   does. [1]
 - Support editable trees. [2]
 - Add key mapping for the dong sign.
 - Optionally remember on/off state per-site, using FUEL or the Content
   Preferences service. [3] Maybe limit this feature to bookmarks (FUEL), since
   the UI to set the preferences would be easier to figure out.
 - The extension has some commented code towards supporting Thunderbird 3a1. The
   main issues are identifying the myriad of textboxes that AVIM should ignore,
   and finding a keyboard shortcut for toggling AVIM that won't conflict with
   any of the shortcuts used on any of Thunderbird's windows.
