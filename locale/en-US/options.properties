# Extension Monitor ############################################################

# Label for the notification bar warning about an extension like Mudim or Typing Vietnamese being enabled and turned on. Note that either extension can be enabled but turned off. In that case, the extension has no effect on text input and does not interfere with AVIM, so this message does not appear. Avoid using the term "enabled" in this string, to avoid confusion with the act of disabling an extension via about:addons. The first placeholder is filled with either mudim.label or typing-vietnamese.label.
ext-monitor-note.label=%S is also turned on and may interfere with AVIM.
# Label for the button that turns off Mudim or Typing Vietnamese (as opposed to disabling that extension). Avoid using the term "disable" in this string, to avoid confusion with the act of disabling an extension via about:addons. The first placeholder is filled with either mudim.label or typing-vietnamese.label.
ext-monitor-button.label=Turn Off %S
# Mneumonic for the button that turns off Mudim or Typing Vietnamese. This string should contain a single character that also appears in mudim-button.label. The user can press Alt+U (Ctrl+U on the Mac) to perform the same action as clicking the Turn Off button.
ext-monitor-button.accesskey=u
# Localized name of the Mudim extension. Only translate this string if the Mudim extension is translated into your language.
mudim.label=Mudim
# Localized name of the Typing Vietnamese extension. Only translate this string if the Typing Vietnamese extension is translated into your language.
typing-vietnamese.label=Typing Vietnamese
