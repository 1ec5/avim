# Mudim Monitor ################################################################

# Label for the notification bar warning about Mudim being enabled and turned on. Note that Mudim can be enabled but turned off. In that case, Mudim has no effect on text input and does not interfere with AVIM, so this message does not appear. Avoid using the term "enabled" in this string, to avoid confusion with the act of disabling an extension via the Add-ons window.
mudim-note.label=Mudim is also turned on and may interfere with AVIM.
# Label for the button that turns off Mudim (as opposed to disabling that extension). Avoid using the term "disable" in this string, to avoid confusion with the act of disabling an extension via the Add-ons window.
mudim-button.label=Turn Off Mudim
# Mneumonic for the button that turns off Mudim. This string should contain a single character that also appears in mudim-button.label. The user can press Alt+U (Ctrl+U on the Mac) to perform the same action as clicking the Turn Off Mudim button.
mudim-button.accesskey=u
