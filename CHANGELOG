Until version 20061001, the version number indicated the extension's release
date. Starting with the 20080224.x series, the first part indicates the version
of avim.js that the extension was based on, while the remaining version part
indicates the version of the extension itself, expressed as a Subversion
revision number.

Version 20060714 (Friday, July 14, 2006)
 - Initial release.

Version 20061001 (Sunday, October 1, 2006)
 - Integrated with the latest version of the AVIM script.

Version 20080224.59 (Monday, June 16, 2008)
 - First release by Minh Nguyen, based on a refactored codebase by Hieu Dang.
 - Added support for Firefox 3 and removed support for Firefox 2.
 - Replaced the status bar radio buttons with an unobtrusive popup menu.
 - Added an identical menu under the Edit menu, for those who hide their status
   bars.
 - Added support for windows other than the main browser window, including the
   Bookmark Properties dialog, the Library window, JavaScript prompt() dialogs,
   and any other XUL document affected by an overlay listed in chrome.manifest.
   The about:config filter bar and the Error Console code bar are not supported.
 - Removed keyboard shortcuts that conflicted with built-in shortcuts and other
   extensions.
 - Replaced the "Off" "input method" with a separate "Enabled" option.
 - Added the Ctrl+Shift+V keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+V on the Mac) to toggle
   AVIM on and off; this shortcut does not conflict with any built-in shortcuts,
   but does conflict with Adblock Plus.
 - Replaced the avim_prefs plain text preferences file with entries in Firefox's
   built-in preferences service. Users of previous versions will have to set
   their input method and other options again.
 - Advanced options can be set using about:config. These options are: the IDs of
   text boxes that AVIM should ignore and the actual methods that comprise Auto.
 - Ensured that any preference change is reflected in every open window, as
   well as windows opened from that point on.
 - Localized into Spanish, because Minh knows Spanish.
 - Localized into Vietnamese, in case Firefox ever gets an official translation
   into Vietnamese. One can hope...

Version 20080224.66 (Thursday, June 19, 2008)
 - Fixed the checkbox menu items, which were completely broken.
 - Added option to show and hide the status bar panel.

Version 20080224.87 (Wednesday, July  2, 2008)
 - Added a preference window that currently covers all the options available
   through about:config.
 - Added toolbar buttons for enabling and disabling AVIM and for choosing the
   input method. The buttons can be added to the toolbar using the Customize
   Toolbar dialog box.
 - Added support for AJAX applications like Gmail and rich text editors like
   FCKeditor. More testing is needed, however.
 - Fixed issue where AVIM would ignore words following certain punctuation
   characters, such as curly quotes and ellipses.
 - Changed keyboard shortcut for toggling AVIM to Ctrl+Alt+V (Cmd+Opt+V on the
   Mac) to avoid a collision with Adblock Plus.
 - Added the Ctrl+: (Cmd+:) and Ctrl+; (Cmd+;) keyboard shortcuts to cycle back
   and forward through the input method list.
 - Added the Ctrl+Alt+S (Cmd+Opt+S) keyboard shortcut to toggle the "Enforce
   Spelling" option.
 - Added the Ctrl+Alt+; (Cmd+Opt+;) keyboard shortcut to toggle the "Old
   Accents" option.
 - Removed the menu item to toggle the status bar panel, since it is redundant
   with the preference window now.

Version 20080224.91 (Thursday, July  3, 2008)
 - Added a warning that indicates when Mudim is enabled and turned on, along
   with a button to turn Mudim off (as opposed to disabling the extension).
   Mudim often interferes with AVIM, since the two extensions serve the same
   purpose.
 - Optimized the toolbar button images.

Version 20080224.93 (Friday, July  4, 2008)
 - Updated home page to point to 1ec5.org.
 - Made ignored textbox IDs case-insensitive.

Version 20080224.96 (Saturday, July  5, 2008)
 - Fixed an issue where Mudim would not be turned off after the Disable Mudum
   button is pressed.
 - Added support for the Pencil extension.
 - Fixed an issue where the status bar panel would not work in ChatZilla.

Version 20080224.110 (Sunday, July 13, 2008)
 - Added a "script monitor", which fixes compatibility issues with the AVIM/HIM,
   VietTyping, and VietUni scripts by turning off any instances of them when
   typing in a webpage.
 - Added a preference to disable the script monitor, in case it causes
   performance issues.
 - Forced ignored textbox IDs to lowercase.
 - Cleared ID textbox after the ID is ignored.
 - Fixed encoding issues that prevented the Vietnamese locale from loading.

Version 20080224.118 (Tuesday, July 15, 2008)
 - Added an option to allow words that begin with "dz" or "f", even when
   spelling rules are enforced.
 - Added support for more rich text editors, including Dojo's Dijit.Editor.
 - Added support for disabling some versions of mViet.
 - Added support for disabling the CHIM and Mudim scripts when typing in a
   webpage. The two scripts are not disabled by default.
 - Added explicit menu items for switching to the previous and next input
   methods. Previously, keys for cycling methods would move around as the input
   method changed, but this approach caused problems in Mac OS X.
 - Options such as input method can no longer be changed when AVIM is disabled.
   Before, the menu items for these options were disabled, but the keyboard
   shortcuts were still active.

Version ${Version} (${Date})
 - Added French localization.
