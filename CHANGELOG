Until version 20061001, the version number indicated the extension's release
date. Starting with the 20080224.x series, the first part indicates the version
of avim.js that the extension was based on, while the remaining version part
indicates the version of the extension itself, expressed as a Subversion
revision number.

Version 20060714 (Friday, July 14, 2006)
 - Initial release by Hieu Dang.
 - Allows users to type Vietnamese in the search bar.
 - Saves the user's choice of typing method and other preferences.

Version 20061001 (Sunday, October 1, 2006)
 - AVIM works correctly with Firefox 2.0 SearchPluginHacks (0.1.3).
 - install.rdf is updated to conform with Mozilla guidelines for Firefox
   extension developers.

Version 20080224.59 (Monday, June 16, 2008)
 - First release by Minh Nguyen, based on a refactored codebase by Hieu Dang.
 - Added support for Firefox 3 and removed support for Firefox 2.
 - Replaced the status bar radio buttons with an unobtrusive popup menu.
 - Added an identical menu under the Edit menu, for those who hide their status
   bars.
 - Added support for windows other than the main browser window, including the
   Bookmark Properties dialog, the Library window, JavaScript prompt() dialogs,
   and any other XUL document affected by an overlay listed in chrome.manifest.
   The about:config filter bar and the Error Console code bar are not supported.
 - Removed keyboard shortcuts that conflicted with built-in shortcuts and other
   extensions.
 - Replaced the "Off" "input method" with a separate "Enabled" option.
 - Added the Ctrl+Shift+V keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+V on the Mac) to toggle
   AVIM on and off; this shortcut does not conflict with any built-in shortcuts,
   but does conflict with Adblock Plus.
 - Replaced the avim_prefs plain text preferences file with entries in Firefox's
   built-in preferences service. Users of previous versions will have to set
   their input method and other options again.
 - Advanced options can be set using about:config. These options are: the IDs of
   text boxes that AVIM should ignore and the actual methods that comprise Auto.
 - Ensured that any preference change is reflected in every open window, as
   well as windows opened from that point on.
 - Localized into Spanish, because Minh knows Spanish.
 - Localized into Vietnamese, in case Firefox ever gets an official translation
   into Vietnamese. One can hope...

Version 20080224.66 (Thursday, June 19, 2008)
 - Fixed the checkbox menu items, which were completely broken.
 - Added option to show and hide the status bar panel.

Version 20080224.87 (Wednesday, July  2, 2008)
 - Added a preference window that currently covers all the options available
   through about:config.
 - Added toolbar buttons for enabling and disabling AVIM and for choosing the
   input method. The buttons can be added to the toolbar using the Customize
   Toolbar dialog box.
 - Added support for AJAX applications like Gmail and rich text editors like
   FCKeditor. More testing is needed, however.
 - Fixed issue where AVIM would ignore words following certain punctuation
   characters, such as curly quotes and ellipses.
 - Changed keyboard shortcut for toggling AVIM to Ctrl+Alt+V (Cmd+Opt+V on the
   Mac) to avoid a collision with Adblock Plus.
 - Added the Ctrl+: (Cmd+:) and Ctrl+; (Cmd+;) keyboard shortcuts to cycle back
   and forward through the input method list.
 - Added the Ctrl+Alt+S (Cmd+Opt+S) keyboard shortcut to toggle the "Enforce
   Spelling" option.
 - Added the Ctrl+Alt+; (Cmd+Opt+;) keyboard shortcut to toggle the "Old
   Accents" option.
 - Removed the menu item to toggle the status bar panel, since it is redundant
   with the preference window now.

Version 20080224.91 (Thursday, July  3, 2008)
 - Added a warning that indicates when Mudim is enabled and turned on, along
   with a button to turn Mudim off (as opposed to disabling the extension).
   Mudim often interferes with AVIM, since the two extensions serve the same
   purpose.
 - Optimized the toolbar button images.

Version 20080224.93 (Friday, July  4, 2008)
 - Updated home page to point to 1ec5.org.
 - Made ignored textbox IDs case-insensitive.

Version 20080224.96 (Saturday, July  5, 2008)
 - Fixed an issue where Mudim would not be turned off after the Disable Mudum
   button is pressed.

 - Fixed an issue where the status bar panel would not work in ChatZilla.

Version 20080224.110 (Sunday, July 13, 2008)
 - Added a "script monitor", which fixes compatibility issues with the AVIM/HIM,
   VietTyping, and VietUni scripts by turning off any instances of them when
   typing in a webpage.
 - Added a preference to disable the script monitor, in case it causes
   performance issues.
 - Forced ignored textbox IDs to lowercase.
 - Cleared ID textbox after the ID is ignored.
 - Fixed encoding issues that prevented the Vietnamese locale from loading.

Version 20080224.118 (Tuesday, July 15, 2008)
 - Added an option to allow words that begin with "dz" or "f", even when
   spelling rules are enforced.
 - Added support for more rich text editors, including Dojo's Dijit.Editor.
 - Added support for disabling some versions of mViet.
 - Added support for disabling the CHIM and Mudim scripts when typing in a
   webpage. The two scripts are not disabled by default.
 - Added explicit menu items for switching to the previous and next input
   methods. Previously, keys for cycling methods would move around as the input
   method changed, but this approach caused problems in Mac OS X.
 - Options such as input method can no longer be changed when AVIM is disabled.
   Before, the menu items for these options were disabled, but the keyboard
   shortcuts were still active.

Version 20080224.139 (Tuesday, July 29, 2008)
 - Added French localization.
 - Added support for beta versions of Flock 2.

 - Single-line textboxes no longer jump to the beginning whenever adding
   diacritics to words.

   typing in the Bookmarks sidebar's filter bar.
 - Fixed behavior on editable menulists (combo boxes), used in Google Toolbar
   and Firefox's Live Titles feature.

 - Reduced the number of undo/redo levels created when adding diacritics,
   speeding up typing in textboxes with lots of existing text.
 - The preferences panel now displays correctly on the Mac even if
   general.useragent.locale has been modified.

 - Added support for Songbird and Instantbird.
 - Added support for alpha versions of Firefox 3.1.
 - Added support for the googlebar, StumbleUpon, and Venkman extensions.
 - Rewrote core functions for increased performance.
 - The first word typed into a rich textbox is no longer flipped around.
 - Fixed an issue where words beginning with "z" were accepted.
 - Words that begin with "q" but not "qu" are rejected. So are words that begin
   with "ka", "ko", or "ku".
 - Fixed an issue where special textboxes in Firefox, such as the search and
   find bars, could not be ignored.
 - Fixed an issue where some in-page scripts would not be disabled.
 - Added a Restore to Default button to the Ignored Textboxes tab of the
   preference panel.

   in Mac OS X. Now the menu bar remains visible, standard key combinations
   work, and AVIM recognizes the panel's Textbox ID textbox.
 - Vinova can now be automatically disabled on webpages via a hidden preference.

Version 20080728.181 (Sunday, August 10, 2008)
 - Added support for Pencil as a standalone application.

   textbox was filled out.

Version 20080728.185 (Tuesday, August 12, 2008)
 - Fixed an issue where adding a tone mark at the end of a word forced the
   entire word to lowercase.
 - Relaxed spelling rules, since the spelling feature is intended to reject only
   words that would be unpronounceable in Vietnamese. "Ka", "ko", and "ku" are
   no longer rejected. Also, "gin`" is allowed again.

Version 20080728.195 (Saturday, August 16, 2008)
 - This CHANGELOG is no longer included in packaged versions of this extension,
   to reduce download size. A history of changes to AVIM can be viewed at the
   project's homepage.
 - Added simplified and traditional Chinese localizations by Karan Misra.
 - Fixed removing diacritics by repeating them (e.g., entering "o^^" should
   produce "o^").
 - Relaxed the spelling rules further, allowing "p" at the beginning of a word.
   By request, "y" is also allowed where "i" would normally be used.
 - Fixed an issue where "uu" ("u+u", "uu+", etc.) in the middle of a word was
   accepted.
 - Fixed typos in the Spanish localization.
