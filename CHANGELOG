Until version 20061001, the version number indicated the extension's release
date. Starting with version 1.0.0.20071102, the first three version parts
indicate the version of the extension itself, while the fourth part indicates
the version of avim.js that the extension was based on.

Version 20060714 (July 14, 2006)

Version 20061001 (October 1, 2006)

Version 1.0.0.20071102 (?)
 - Added support for Firefox 3.0.
 - Replaced the status bar radio buttons with an unobtrusive popup menu.
 - Added an identical menu under the Edit menu, for those who hide their status
   bars.
 - Switched to keyboard shortcuts that no longer conflict with shortcuts in
   Firefox or (hopefully) other extensions.
 - Replaced the "Off" "input method" with a separate "Enabled" option.
 - Added the Ctrl+Shift+V keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+V in the Mac) to toggle
   AVIM on and off.
 - Replaced the avim_prefs plain text preferences file with entries in Firefox's
   built-in preferences service. Users of previous versions will have to set
   their input method and other options again. Advanced options can be set using
   about:config.
 - Added support for windows other than the main browser window, including the
   Bookmark Properties window, the Bookmarks Organizer, JavaScript confirm()
   dialogs, and any other XUL document affected by an overlay listed in
   chrome.manifest.
 - Ensured that windows are updated upon focus to reflect input method changes
   in other windows.
 - Localized into Vietnamese, in case Firefox ever gets an official translation
   into Vietnamese. One can hope...
